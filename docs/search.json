I will drop your two lowest quiz grades.\nHomework 50%: At the end of a group of content, a homework will be assigned that will ask you to analyze a dataset and answer questions related to that concept group. These homeworks are always due the Sunday after assigned at 11:59 pm China time. Each homework/midterm will also have a best graph contest, where the person whose classmates vote as having the best graph wins some extra credit points.\nHomework checks 4%: To make sure you are making good progress on your homework, the Sunday before the homework is due (except for the first homework) you will be required to submit your progress on the homework so far. You are required to have tried to have answered all the questions covered by the lectures and textbook up to that Sunday. I will not check your answers but rather check to see if you have made a good effort to answer all the questions derived from the material already covered. If you have a reasonable answer for each question checked you will get full points. If you have not made an effort to answer all the questions reviewed you will get a zero.\nUnit 4 homework - paper analysis 5%: At the end of Unit 4, you will select a news article and then do some research on the underlying statistics presented in the news article, critiquing if the news article accurately represented the study reference in the article.\nFinal project 25%: Similar to the Unit 2 homework, the final exam will ask you to analyze a dataset using all the strategies we have learned in class. The paper for this project should be about 2000 words.\nData Camp labs 5%: A number of labs on the website Data Camp will be assigned to you; these labs are pass/fail and you will receive full credit if you complete each of the labs by the specified due date.\nSyllabus quiz 1%: A short quiz after the first class regarding the course requirements.\nExtra credit maximum 3%: You have several opportunities to earn extra credit. There will be three graph contests, whereby the student who is voted by the other students as having the best graph will receive extra credit points. Additionally, those who respond to other students questions on Teams will also be eligible to earn extra credit points."

You can submit multiple times on Teams so make sure you have a nearly complete version uploaded even if you want to keep working on it right up to the deadline.

    "text": "Academic Dishonesty Policy\nDon’t cheat. Don’t be that person. Yes, you. You know exactly what I’m talking about too.\nMore specifically, you are expected to strictly adhere to the Duke Kunshan University Community Standard in all of your work and participation, and violations will be enforced. More details can be found here.\nAll work must be done exclusively by the individual to whom it has been assigned. You should assume that collaboration on assignments, the use of previously-assigned homework, quizzes and answer keys, outside sources or outside aids (both written and electronic) are not allowed unless explicitly noted in the assignment guidelines. All cases of suspected cheating will be referred for adjudication to the Dean’s Office. Any violation for which a student is found responsible is considered grounds for failure in the course.\nIt may sound cliché to say, but if you cheat and borrow other’s code or answers you are only cheating yourself; you will not learn how to do statistics and doing so will mean you will do worse on the midterm and the final anyway. Cheating is ultimately self-defeating so for both of our benefit, please, don’t do it. If you are having trouble completing the assignment and feel tempted to cheat, please contact me directly instead with the difficulties you are having."

If your regression specification meets all of the conditions for linear regression, this plot will illustrate the independent impact of the predictor variable on the response variable.\nThere are a few packages that can generate these plots, car being perhaps the best supported.\n\nlibrary(car)\n\ncrPlots(mod1, terms = ~ ., layout = NULL)\n\n\n\n\nYou can interpret these graphs as displaying the change in MPG from the mean (listed on the y axis) as displ or wt changes over its range. These are a type of marginal plots - it show the marginal impact of the predictor variable on the response variable after controlling for the impact of all other variables.\n\nNote that in the crPlot() call, the terms function is a one-sided formula that specifies a subset of the predictor variables for which you would like to generate plots. One component-plus-residual plot is drawn for each regressor. The default ~ . is to plot all numeric regressors. You can modify this term to subtract terms with the specification terms = ~ . - X3, which would plot against all regressors except for X3, while terms = ~ log(X4) would give the plot for the predictor X4 that is represented in the model by log(X4). If this argument is a quoted name of one of the predictors, the component-plus-residual plot is drawn for that predictor only.\n\n\nFor the layout option, if set to a value like c(1, 1) or c(4, 3), the layout of the graph will have this many rows and columns. If not set, the program will select an appropriate layout. If the number of graphs exceed nine, you must select the layout yourself, or you will get a maximum of nine per page.\n\nFor more details on crPlots(), you can go here:\ncrPlots documentation"
