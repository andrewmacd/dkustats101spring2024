# Planning 

## Expectations

You should develop some expectations based on some pre-existing ideas about how you think the data is related. Pick `Calories` and another quantitative variable and write down how you expect the two to be related. 

> Write down your expectation and provide a brief reason for the expectation. Remember to describe your expectation about the relationship between the two variables in terms of direction, form, strength, and outliers.

## Direction of the relationship

Make a decision about which variable is the outcome variable you care about and which is the variable that predicts it. Write down your choice.

# Investigation

## Distribution displays

### Histograms

- Make histograms of your two variables using `ggplot()` and `geom_histogram()`. Do you see anything unusual? What do you think these distributions indicate about the possible relationship between the two?

### Scatterplot

- Make a high-quality scatterplot of the two variables using `geom_point()`. You can add a smoother to the scatterplot by adding a `geom_smooth()` layer to your `ggplot`.

Describe the relationship between the two variables using the terms we learned in class.  

- Direction
- Form
- Strength
- Outliers

> Does the relationship match your expectations? Why or why not? Write some notes about comparing expectations vs. reality.

### Correlation

Find correlation result â€“ does it match the scatterplot? Your expectations? Why or why not?

The RStudio code for correlations is:

```
cor(x, y, use="complete.obs")
```

## Analysis

### Outliers

If you have any outliers, identify them. Do you think they should be excluded from your analysis? Why or why not? If you remove the outliers (via the `filter()` verb), does it change your correlation? The shape of the smoother?

### Transformations

- Could the relationship of your two chosen variables benefit from being re-expressed? Try a few re-expressions and see how it affects the relationship and correlation. 
  + Hint: remember, you can use the `mutate()` verb in a piped command, such as: `mutate(logcals = log(Calories))` 

### Conclusion

Overall, summarize what you have learned about the relationship of your two variables. 

# Extra

If you have time, complete the above steps with additional variables.
